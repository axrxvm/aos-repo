# aos-repo
Public package repository for aOS.

This repository is a base for all officially supported aOS related packages/images/files/kernel modules. The aOS Package Manager uses the `main` branch of this repository as default except otherwise changed.

Every individual package/file/kernel module/etc. in this repository is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE) if not explicitly mentioned.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by architecture and category:

```
/{arch}/{category}/{item}/{itemfiles}
```

### Architectures
- **i386** - 32-bit x86 architecture
- **x86_64** - 64-bit x86 architecture

### Categories
- **iso** - ISO installation images (no subdirectories, files stored directly)
- **akmcc** - AOS Kernel Module Compiler Collection packages
- **kmodule** - Kernel modules
- **pkgs** - Software packages
- **etc** - Configuration files and miscellaneous items
- **tmp** - Temporary files and builds

### Checksum Files

Every item directory (or the iso directory directly) contains:
- **keys.txt** - SHA256 checksums in plain text format
- **keys.json** - SHA256 checksums in JSON format

These checksums are automatically generated by GitHub Actions whenever files are added or modified in the repository.

## Automated Checksum Generation

This repository uses a GitHub Action workflow that automatically generates SHA256 checksums for all files in item directories. The workflow:

1. Triggers on pushes to `main` and `releases/**` branches
2. Scans all item directories for files
3. Generates `keys.txt` (plain text) and `keys.json` (JSON format) containing SHA256 checksums
4. Automatically commits and pushes the checksum files

The workflow can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab.
