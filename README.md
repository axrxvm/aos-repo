# aos-repo
Public package repository for aOS.

This repository is a base for all officially supported aOS related packages/images/files/kernel modules. The aOS Package Manager uses the `main` branch of this repository as default except otherwise changed.

Every individual package/file/kernel module/etc. in this repository is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE) if not explicitly mentioned.

### Checksum Files

Every item directory (or the iso directory directly) contains:
- **keys.txt** - SHA256 checksums in plain text format
- **keys.json** - SHA256 checksums in JSON format
These checksums are automatically generated by GitHub Actions whenever files are added or modified in the repository.
